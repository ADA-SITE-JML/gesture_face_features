### Analysis of the efficiency of the gesture and face feature extraction
A project that analyzes the efficiency of the gesture and face feature extraction

- Heatmaps should react to activity (hands, mouth)
- Do we lose information when images are resized (e.g. can we see the fingers clearly)?
- A sign with a slightly different camera perspective should be classified as the same, differ slightly intraclass, and a lot interclass (clarify)
- After testing different models we should figure out which model is the best.
- Mediapipe can be tested, but our main concentration will be in common CNN models.

Input will be static (images). **Keras** is used.
