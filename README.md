# Evaluation of spatial feature extraction methods in facial and gesture detection problems

Code repository for the experiments conducted in the paper. We explore the effectiveness of spatial feature extraction methods in the context of hand gesture classification tasks, proposing a methodology for assessing
the transferability of various pre-trained models to a target domain. A major concern is the computational cost and transferability of these models. We evaluate key model transferability estimation (MTE) methods and propose a multi-step, resource-efficient methodology to qualify the suitability of pretrained learning models for pattern recognition.
